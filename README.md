# Checkout App

This is a simple checkout app built with Laravel. It allows users to add items to their cart, and then proceed to checkout. The app also includes a database to store user information and order history.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies using Composer:

```
composer install
```

Next, create a new database and update the `.env` file with your database credentials:

```
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

Finally, run the migrations to create the necessary tables in the database:

```
php artisan migrate
```
